# Real-Time SPAM HAM Mail Detection


## Project Overview
This project is a spam mail detection system built using machine learning and Streamlit. The application allows users to test if an email is spam, add training data dynamically, and evaluate the model's performance. The model uses the MultinomialNB algorithm from scikit-learn, and additional features are extracted from the email text to improve detection accuracy. 

## Features
1. Test an Email: Users can input an email and the system will classify it as spam or not spam.
2. Add Training Data: Users can add new emails and label them as spam or not spam, which will be used to retrain the model.
3. Evaluate Model: Users can evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
